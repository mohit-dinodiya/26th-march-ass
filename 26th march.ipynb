    "Multicollinearity is a common problem that arises in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems in the model because it becomes difficult to distinguish the effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable. Multicollinearity can also cause the coefficients of the independent variables to be unstable or unreliable, making it difficult to interpret the results of the model.\n",

    "One way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate the correlation matrix of the independent variables and look for high correlations between variables. A correlation matrix is a matrix that shows the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables in the model. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with values close to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation, values close to 1 indicating a strong positive correlation, and values close to 0 indicating no correlation. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates perfect correlation, meaning that the two variables are exactly the same.\n",

VIF measures the degree to which a variable is correlated with the other independent variables in the model.

Generally, a VIF value greater than 5 is considered problematic and may require further investigation.\n",
